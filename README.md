# synfuzz

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jrozner/synfuzz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jrozner/synfuzz)

A library for building fuzzers/test case generators based on a formal grammar. This is intended to provide primitives that can be used for targeting specific grammar definition languages (eg. ANTLR) so that test case generation can happen directly from the grammar definition file.
